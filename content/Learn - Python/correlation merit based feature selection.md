# general info on feature selection

Attempt was made at using the below algorithm for a 500 feature dataset.

The time complexity is questionable at best.

Hence, an attempt was made at only considering best combo suggested by dendrogram from hierarchical cluster based on feature correlation.

- [ ] code tba

also, the following implementation of the same algo (I think?) is found. maybe it's faster? need further investigation when free.
