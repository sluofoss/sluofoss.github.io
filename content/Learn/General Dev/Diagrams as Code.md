# potential diagrams in #markdown
> [!IMPORTANT] Commonmark out of box doesn't seem to support any diagram render capability. Hence everything here is targeting some flavour of markdown.


- prismjs (not a diagram but do syntax highlighting of the code itself)
- plantuml (really old and mature)
- mermaid (avail in github and gitlab)
- d2 
	- (need local install compiler to generate visual, not supported out of the box)
	- have a lot of additional features than mermaid
	- https://text-to-diagram.com/?example=code&b=mermaid
	- https://github.com/terrastruct/d2?tab=readme-ov-file#install
- https://kroki.io/
  - this seems to be a website (with self host option) that offer an api call to convert encoded diagram strings to visual image for a lot of different visualization DSL
- [[Terraform]] outputs plots in graphviz DOT format.
  - below 2 source describe a way to use external/self hosted services to embed the diagram in markdown as an api call to website. 
    - http://bijanebrahimi.github.io/blog/graphviz-in-markdown.html
    - https://github.com/TLmaK0/gravizo
    - the two source describes calling web api with multiline url. Not sure if that ever worked but currently it doesnt in github markdown nor quartz compilation. Also gravizo's readme shows a different method of feeding the link of the github readme into their website to generate the plot instead, but this is not viable cos the url for a digital garden **SHOULD NOT** be hardcoded.
  - looking to see if there are method to export diagram from [[Terraform]] in mermaid instead.
    - conversion tool from `dot` (graphviz) to mermaid not found.
    - https://github.com/RoseSecurity/Terramaid
      - custom install to convert terraform to mermaid (i.e. use this instead of `terraform graph`)
      - https://github.com/RoseSecurity/Terramaid/issues/25
        - does not support opentofu yet
    - https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30519#issuecomment-2442465590
      - mentions 
        - terramaid
        - sed approach
          - https://www.heaton.dev/2022/05/use-terraform-graph-in-mermaidjs/
  - https://kroki.io/ has api taking diagram encoded using deflate + base64 algorithm. This can act as a substitute until one learn how to use `sed` to do dirty conversion from `dot` to `mermaid` as described in 
  - https://www.gravizo.com/ is another website with api that uses graphviz to render DOT, PlantUML and UMLGraph syntax diagrams
    - example
    - <img src='https://g.gravizo.com/svg?%0A digraph G {%0A   main -> parse -> execute;%0A   main -> init;%0A   main -> cleanup;%0A   execute -> make_string;%0A   execute -> printf%0A   init -> make_string;%0A   main -> printf;%0A   execute -> compare;%0A }
'/>
  - #Obsidian has plugins that support graphviz. However, to render output from custom obsidian plugin feels complicated. 
    - https://joschua.io/posts/2023/09/01/obsidian-publish-dataview
      - this is trying to:
        - use some api call of the dataview plugin to convert things into markdown, 
        - embedded in any markdown doc, 
        - and then use obsidian publish.
